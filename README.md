# ft_ls
Summary: In short: This project will make you recode the command “ls”

The ls command is one of the first commands you have learned to use with shell. It is
also one you are using the most. Perhaps you have already asked yourself how is this
function coded? Thanks to this project, you will soon find out.
To Recode ls and some of its options will allow you to find out how to interact with the file system using C. 

After all, you already know how to open, read, write and close a file. But, what about the directories? Special files? Rights,
dates or sizes of the files?
And while I am on the topic, the quality of your libft will make the difference
between a pleasant project experience and an abominable one. For example, if you add ft_printf to your libft
, your life will be more enjoyable. It is possible to complete the ft_ls project without the ft_printf function. 
By the same token, you can easily eat a yogurt with your fingers. A spoon would still make your experience more pleasant.

Objectives
The project ft_ls opens the path to the Unix branch of the sphere system. For the first time, you will have to face the one
libc functions that will allow you to do other things than just read or write on a file descriptor (this is to simplify of 
course). You will discover a sub-system of functions of operating system’s API, the associated data structures, as well as the 
management of memory allocation and the associated data.

ft_ls is also a great opportunity to think about the structure of your code before you even start writing your code.
ft_ls’ bad reputation is due to students discovering too late in the game that their (lack of) initial design is preventing
them from finishing their project without refactorizing a great part of their code. I admit that it can be frustrating...
To conclude, ft_ls is another opportunity to add to your libft new practical func-tions. Browsing a file and identifying 
directories is quite common in programming. Re-member that you you will have to do it on many future occasions.
Improving your libft today will save you time tomorrow.
